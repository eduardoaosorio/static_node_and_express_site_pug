Techdegree Project 6

## Description

Portfolio site to showcase the projects I've built. The site contains a modern landing page, an about page, and a series of project pages.

### Style Changes

- The font has been updated to "Inter" everywhere.
- Class "btn-link" "background-color" CSS property has been set to "#000".
- Paragraph element's color property has been updated from "#666" to "#656565".
- "letter-spacing" and "text-transform" CSS properties have been removed.
- Every instance of "background-color" set to "#fefefe" has been updated to "#fff".
- The "word-break" CSS property has been set to "break-all" on the div with class "skills-contact-box" and on a paragraph in the error view with id="error-stack" to avoid text from overflowing at certain device widths.
